# BTree-Demo
Implementation of B-Tree and Experiment for performance at different order of B-Tree

## File Descriptions
> <p><strong>node.c, node.h</strong>: Node structure definitions and functions </p>
> <p><strong>BTree.c, BTree.h</strong>: Implementation of BTree data structure </p>
> <p><strong>Experiment.c</strong> does the following: 
  Takes command line input m <br>
  Construct m-order B-Tree with the integer data present in Input.txt <br>
  Measures time for searching data present in SearchInput.txt </p>
> <p><strong>plot.png, plot1.png</strong>: Plot showing performance with m = 2 to 2000 </p>
